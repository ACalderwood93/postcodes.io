				h3 Why?
				p The people behind Postcodes.io are the same people behind Ideal-Postcodes.co.uk. We run a paid API that takes UK addressing data locked behind high-cost commercial licensing regimes and we try our best to offer it to developers at a fair price with a simple API.

				p We started Postcodes.io to do the same thing. We'd like to make Ordnance Survey's open data easier to use and available at a fair price (free).

				p This API is designed for primarily for people who want to link Postcodes to location data ([reverse] geocoding) and to lookup basic information on postcodes.

				h3 Github
				p If come across bugs or have any requests please create an issue on our 
					a(href="https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io") Github repository 
					| or make a pull request. We'll be happy to take a look
